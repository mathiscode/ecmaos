[ecmaOS](https://ecmaos.sh) is a browser-based operating system kernel and suite of applications written primarily in TypeScript, AssemblyScript, and C++. It's the successor of [web3os](https://github.com/web3os-org/kernel).

The goal is to create a kernel and supporting apps that tie together modern web technologies and utilities to form an "operating system" that can run on modern browsers, not just to create a "desktop experience". It offers the ability to run a wide variety of apps on top of an already (mostly) sandboxed foundation, offering some measure of security by default as well as rich developer tooling. Its main use case is to provide a consistent environment for running web apps, but it has features that allow for more powerful custom scenarios, such as a platform for custom applications, games, and more.

This is NOT intended to be a "Linux kernel in Javascript" - while it takes its heaviest inspiration from Linux, it is more experimental and follows different design principles and architecture, and also doesn't need to cover nearly the same scope.

## Basic Concepts

### Apps

> [/apps](/apps)

- These are full applications that are developed specifically to work with ecmaOS
- Refer to the full list of [official published apps on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/org/ecmaos-apps)
- See the [APPS.md](/APPS.md) file for a list of community apps; submit a PR to add your app!
- An app is an npm package, in which the bin file has a shebang line of `#!ecmaos:bin:app:myappname`
- Its default export (or exported `main` function) will be called with the `ProcessEntryParams` object
- They can be installed from the terminal using the `install` command, e.g. `# install @ecmaos-apps/code`
- Run the installed app (bins are linked to `/usr/bin`): `# code /root/hello.js`
- During development, it can be useful to run a [Verdaccio](https://github.com/verdaccio/verdaccio) server to test local packages
- To publish to Verdaccio, run `# npm publish --registry http://localhost:4873` in your app's development environment
- Then to install from your local registry, run (inside ecmaOS) `# install @myscope/mypackage --registry http://localhost:4873`

<!-- Will revamp once more work is done on this -->
<!-- ### BIOS

> [/core/bios](/core/bios)

- The BIOS is a C++ module compiled to WebAssembly with [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org) providing performance-critical functionality
- The BIOS has its own filesystem, located at `/bios` — this allows data to be copied in and out of the BIOS for custom code and utilities
- The main idea is that data and custom code can be loaded into it from the OS for WASM-native performance, as well as providing various utilities
- Confusingly, the Kernel loads the BIOS — not the other way around -->

### Binaries

> [/core/kernel/src/tree/wasm.ts](/core/kernel/src/tree/wasm.ts)

- The native binary format for ecmaOS is WebAssembly
- The kernel supports both WASI Preview 1 and WASI Preview 2 (WIP)
- You can run WASM binaries directly:
  - `/root/bin/hello.wasm --help`
- The `.wasm` extension is optional
- Compiling can be as simple as:
  - `$ rustc --target wasm32-wasip1 -o hello.wasm hello.rs`
  - `$ emcc -o hello.wasm hello.c -sSTANDALONE_WASM`
- You can also load WASM+JS harnesses manually
- There is a second, separate `.wasm` execution path, `/bin/wali` ([/core/kernel/src/bin/wali.mjs](/core/kernel/src/bin/wali.mjs)), for **WALI**-format modules -- musl compiled to call `@zenfs/linux`'s real kernel syscalls (`SYS_open`, `SYS_read`, ...) directly, rather than through a WASI ABI. WALI and WASI Preview 1 are different, incompatible module formats (a preview1 binary cannot run under `/bin/wali` or vice versa without recompiling), and `wasm32-wali-linux-musl` is currently a Tier-3 rustc target requiring an out-of-fork LLVM build -- there is no mature toolchain yet to produce real WALI programs with. `/bin/wali` is real and working today, proven against hand-assembled test modules, ready for whenever that toolchain matures.
- **Known limitation, confirmed by running a hand-assembled tight-loop module:** the preview1/preview2 `.wasm` path (`Wasm.run`/`runComponent` in [wasm.ts](src/tree/wasm.ts)) calls `_start` directly on the main thread with no yield point unless the module was itself compiled with asyncify. A module with a real infinite loop and no such yield point freezes the tab outright -- `^C` cannot reach it, because the same main thread that would need to notice the keypress is the one spinning. Fixing this for real would mean moving preview1/preview2 execution off the main thread into a Worker, which hasn't happened. `/bin/wali`, by contrast, runs as a genuine `@zenfs/linux` `Thread` and IS interruptible via `Process.kill(Signal.INT)` -- only the older preview1/preview2 loader has this gap.

### Commands

> [/core/kernel/src/bin/commands](/core/kernel/src/bin/commands)

- `Commands` are the kernel's own programs, e.g. `download`, `install`, `load`, `mount`, `passwd`. Each is a real `execve`'d program that reaches main-thread-only capabilities (DOM, WebAuthn, the kernel's singletons) through custom syscalls and presenters.

### Coreutils

> [/core/utils](/core/utils)

- `Coreutils` are similar to `Commands`, but are provided by the `@ecmaos/coreutils` package, e.g. `cat`, `cd`, `chmod`, `cp`, `echo`, `git`, `ls`, `mkdir`, `mv`, `pwd`, `rm`, `rmdir`, `stat`, `touch`, etc.

### Devices

> [/devices](/devices)

- Refer to the full list of [official devices on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/org/ecmaos-devices)
- See the [DEVICES.md](/DEVICES.md) file for a list of community devices; submit a PR to add your device!
- Devices get loaded on boot, e.g. `/dev/bluetooth`, `/dev/random`, `/dev/battery`, etc.
- A device can support being "run" by a user, e.g. `# /dev/battery status`
- Devices may also be directly read/written using `fs` methods, and will behave accordingly (or have no effect if not supported)
- An individual device module can provide multiple device drivers, e.g. `/dev/usb` provides `/dev/usb-mydevice-0001-0002`

### Filesystems

> [/core/utils/src/commands/mount.ts](/core/utils/src/commands/mount.ts)

ecmaOS supports multiple filesystem backends powered by [zenfs](https://zenfs.dev), allowing you to mount various storage types into the virtual filesystem.

#### Supported Filesystem Types

- **memory**: In-memory filesystem (temporary, lost on page reload)
- **indexeddb**: IndexedDB-backed persistent filesystem
- **webstorage**: WebStorage-backed filesystem (localStorage or sessionStorage)
- **webaccess**: File System Access API filesystem (requires user interaction)
- **singlebuffer**: Filesystem backed by a single buffer
- **fetch**: Remote filesystem via HTTP fetch
- **xml**: DOM XML filesystem (WIP)
- **zip**: Read-only filesystem from a zip archive (file or URL)
- **iso**: Read-only filesystem from an ISO image (file or URL)
- **dropbox**: Dropbox filesystem (WIP)
- **s3**: S3 filesystem (WIP)
- **googledrive**: Google Drive filesystem (WIP)

#### Basic Usage

```sh
# Mount a memory filesystem
mount -t memory /mnt/tmp

# Mount an IndexedDB store
mount -t indexeddb mydb /mnt/db

# Mount WebStorage (localStorage by default)
mount -t webstorage /mnt/storage

# Mount WebStorage using sessionStorage
mount -t webstorage /mnt/storage -o storage=sessionStorage

# Mount a zip archive
mount -t zip /tmp/archive.zip /mnt/zip

# Mount from a remote URL
mount -t zip https://example.com/archive.zip /mnt/zip

# Mount a fetch filesystem (see utils/fetch-fs-server.js)
mount -t fetch index.json /mnt/api -o baseUrl=http://localhost:30808

# List all mounted filesystems
mount -l

# Unmount a filesystem
umount /mnt/tmp
```

#### /etc/fstab

The kernel automatically processes `/etc/fstab` during boot to mount filesystems. The fstab format is space or tab-separated:

```plaintext
source target type [options]
```

**Format:**

- `source`: Device/URL/database name (use `none` for filesystems that don't require a source)
- `target`: Mount point (absolute path)
- `type`: Filesystem type
- `options`: Optional comma-separated key=value pairs

**Example /etc/fstab:**

```plaintext
# ecmaOS fstab - Filesystem mount table
# Format: source target type [options]

# Memory filesystem for temporary data
none /mnt/tmp memory

# IndexedDB filesystem for persistent storage
mydb /mnt/db indexeddb

# WebStorage filesystem using localStorage
none /mnt/storage webstorage storage=localStorage

# Fetch filesystem from a remote API
index.json /mnt/api fetch baseUrl=http://localhost:30808
```

### Generators

> [/turbo/generators](/turbo/generators)

- Generators are used to scaffold new apps, devices, modules, etc.
- They are located in the `turbo/generators` directory of the repository
- They are used by the `turbo gen` command, e.g. `turbo gen app`, `turbo gen device`, `turbo gen module`, etc.

<!-- Will revamp once more work is done on this -->
<!-- ### Jaffa

> [/core/jaffa](/core/jaffa)

- Jaffa is a [Tauri](https://tauri.app) wrapper for the ecmaOS kernel
- It's used to tie the kernel into a desktop or mobile environment, allowing for native functionality
- It needs more work -->

### Internationalization

> [/core/kernel/src/tree/i18n](/core/kernel/src/tree/i18n)

- Built-in translations are in the [/core/kernel/locales](/core/kernel/locales) directory and compiled into the kernel at build time
- Translations can be defined and loaded from the filesystem at runtime
- Override or add translations in `/usr/share/locales/{lang}/{namespace}.json`
  - e.g. `/usr/share/locales/en/kernel.json`
- System locale can be set from the `/etc/default/locale` file
- User locale can be set from the `LANG` environment variable
- `kernel.i18n.t` is the primary translation function for the kernel
- `kernel.i18n.ns` provides access to translation functions for specific namespaces
  - e.g. `kernel.i18n.ns.common('Hello')`

### Kernel

> [/core/kernel](/core/kernel)

- The kernel ties together the various components of the system into a cohesive whole
  - Authentication (Passwords, Passkeys, Credentials)
  - Components (Web Components/Custom Elements)
  - Coreutils (Built-in commands)
  - Devices (Web Hardware APIs)
  - DOM (DOM Utilities and Interfaces)
  - Events (CustomEvents)
  - Filesystem (ZenFS)
  - Internationalization (i18next)
  - Interval Manager (setInterval and cron scheduling)
  - Log Manager (tslog)
  - Memory Manager (Abstractions)
  - Process Manager
  - Protocol Handlers (web+ecmaos://...)
  - Service Worker Manager
  - Shell
  - Sockets (WebSocket, WebTransport)
  - Storage (IndexedDB, localStorage, sessionStorage, etc.)
  - Telemetry (OpenTelemetry)
  - Terminal (xterm.js)
  - User Manager
  - WASM Loader (WASI Preview 1 mostly complete; WASI Preview 2 WIP)
  <!-- - [WebContainer](https://github.com/stackblitz/webcontainer-core) for running Node.js apps -->
  - Web Workers
  - Window Manager (WinBox)

### Metal

> [/core/metal](/core/metal)

- Metal is an API server for allowing connections to physical systems from ecmaOS using [Hono](https://hono.dev)
- Authenticated and encrypted connections with JWK/JWE/JOSE

### Modules

> [/modules](/modules)

- Refer to the full list of [official modules on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/org/ecmaos-modules)
- See the [MODULES.md](/MODULES.md) file for a list of community modules; submit a PR to add your module!
- Modules are dynamically loaded into the kernel at boot and can be enabled or disabled
- They are specified during build via the `ECMAOS_KERNEL_MODULES` environment variable
  - e.g. `ECMAOS_KERNEL_MODULES=@ecmaos-modules/boilerplate@0.1.0,@your/package@1.2.3`
- Versions must be pinned and are mandatory - you cannot use NPM version specifiers
- They can provide additional functionality, devices, commands, etc.
- They offer a [common interface](./core/types/modules.ts) for interacting with the kernel
- Generally they should be written in [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org), but this isn't required

### Packages

- Packages are [NPM packages](https://www.npmjs.com) that are installed into the ecmaOS environment
- They can be installed from the terminal using the `install` command, e.g. `# install @ecmaos-apps/ai`
- Client-side packages should work well
- Some basic Node emulation is in place, but don't expect anything to work at this point
- NPM version specifiers are supported, e.g.:
  - `# install jquery@3.7.1`
  - `# install jquery@^3.7.1`
  - `# install jquery@latest`
- [JSR](https://jsr.io) may be used with the [NPM compatibility layer](https://jsr.io/docs/npm-compatibility):
  - `# install @jsr/defaude__hello-jsr --registry https://npm.jsr.io`

### Screensavers

- Current options: `blank`, `matrix`, `toasters`
- This whole system will be revamped in the future
- Screensavers are currently built into the kernel, but will be migrated to external apps
- You can start the screensaver with the `screensaver` command
- You can set the default screensaver with the `screensaver --set <name>` command
- The screensaver timeout can be set with a `screensaver-timeout` `localStorage` key with the value in milliseconds (default: 60000)

### Shell

- The shell manages the environment, filesystem context, execution, and terminal interface
- System-wide shell configuration is stored in `/etc/shell.toml`
- User-specific shell configuration is stored in `~/.config/shell.toml`
- See [tutorials/shell-customization.md](/tutorials/shell-customization.md) for more information

### Sockets

- A socket manager is available for creating and managing WebSocket and WebTransport connections
- It can be accessed via the `kernel.sockets` property or the `sockets` command

### SWAPI

> [/core/swapi](/core/swapi)

- The SWAPI is an API server running completely inside a service worker using [Hono](https://hono.dev)
- It allows for various operations including the `fs` route to fetch files via URL
- e.g., `# fetch /swapi/fs/home/user/hello.txt`
- e.g., `# fetch /swapi/fake/person/fullName`

### Telemetry

- [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) is used for collecting and analyzing telemetry data from the kernel and applications
- It is only active if the ECMAOS_OPENTELEMETRY_ENDPOINT environment variable is set when building the kernel
- There is a simple test server included in the `utils/opentelemetry` directory that can be used to test the telemetry system: `python3 utils/opentelemetry/otlp-server.py`

### Utils

> [/utils](/utils)

- Utilities and configuration used during development

- The env var `ECMAOS_KERNEL_MODULES` is a list of modules to load on boot; CSV with pinned versions
- The env var `ECMAOS_RECOMMENDED_APPS` is a list of apps to suggest to new users

## App Development

The [apps](/apps) directory in the repository contains some examples of how to develop apps, but there are many approaches you could take.

- `@ecmaos-apps/boilerplate`: A minimal boilerplate app for reference
- `@ecmaos-apps/code`: A simple code editor app using [Monaco](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/); serves as a good reference for more complex apps

Basically, your app's [bin](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json#bin) file has a `main` (or unnamed default) function export that is passed the kernel reference and can use it to interact with the system as needed. A shebang line of `#!ecmaos:bin:app:myappname` is required at the top of the bin file to identify it as an app.

## App/Kernel Interface Example

> See the [docs](https://docs.ecmaos.sh) for more information

```ts
#!ecmaos:bin:app:example
// shebang format: ecmaos:exectype:execnamespace:execname
export default async function main(params: ProcessEntryParams) {
  const { args, kernel, terminal } = params
  kernel.log.info('Hello, world!')
  kernel.log.debug(args)
  terminal.writeln('Hello, world!')
  await kernel.filesystem.fs.writeFile('/tmp/hello.txt', 'Hello, world!')
  const win = kernel.windows.create({ title: 'Example', width: 800, height: 600 })
  const container = document.createElement('div')
  container.innerHTML = '<h1>Hello, world!</h1>'
  win.mount(container)
}
```

## Early Days

ecmaOS is currently in active development. It is not considered stable and the structure and API are very likely to change in unexpected and possibly unannounced ways until version 1.0.0. Use cautiously and at your own risk.

Things to keep in mind:

- If things go wrong or break, clear your browser cache and site data for ecmaOS
- The tests need to be updated and expanded
- The kernel is designed to be run in an environment with a DOM (i.e. a browser)
- Many features are only available on Chromium-based browsers, and many more behind feature flags
- There will be a lot of technical challenges to overcome, and many things will first be implemented in a non-optimal way
- Command interfaces won't match what you might be used to from a traditional Linux environment; not all commands and options are supported. Over time, Linuxish commands will be fleshed out and made to behave in a more familiar way.

## Development

Until v1.0.0, active development will occur on the `main` branch. Once a v1.0.0 release is made, development will shift to a `dev` branch, and `main` will be reserved for stable releases.

[Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) is used to manage the monorepo, and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) is used for package management.

PNPM Workspaces:

- [apps](/apps)
- [core](/core)
- [devices](/devices)
- [modules](/modules)
- [utils](/utils)

A good place to start is viewing the `scripts` property of [package.json](./package.json) in the root of the repository.

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/ecmaos/ecmaos.git

# Install dependencies
cd ecmaos && pnpm install

# Run the dev server
pnpm run dev:kernel

# Run the docs server (optional)
pnpm run dev:docs

# Build
